Face detector for Flash 10(Actionscript 3) based on Viola-Jones face detector algorithm.

Which is Robust Real-Time Face Detection
http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/student/vj/viola-ijcv04.pdf

Implementation from mostly OpenCV
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/

I'm using Vector a lots for speed up which means it requires Flash 10 player.

**Update (2009, 10, 8)**

I added showcase sample application source code which you can see from sample link.
And implement Canny edge detector to boost up speed as OpenCV does.
Canny edge can be used for another computer vision project as seperate module in Flash.
